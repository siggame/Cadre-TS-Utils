# Cadre TypeScript Utils

![{Cadre}](http://i.imgur.com/17wwI3f.png)

This is a collection of utility functions, types, and [tslint] configs,
coded in and for [TypeScript] projects.

It is intended to be used to share common code between [Cadre] projects that
rely on [TypeScript]. However, do not let that stop you from using this package
if you find its utility functions useful.

All code is exported on a per file basis to encourage [tree shaking].
